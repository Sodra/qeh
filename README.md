Like feh, but better, faster, more image formats, simpler, more lightweight,
animation support, and better UI (there is none).

Supports everything from Photoshop and Gimp images via animated gifs to SunOS
raster images and DirectX textures, assuming you have the right plugins
installed (kimageformats).

Uses optimized SSE4.1 code and threadpools for high quality scaling and is
generally good (thanks to carewolf who implemented it in Qt).
